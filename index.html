<h1>The Washington Capitals</h1>
Background: 
<p>The Washington Capitals are a hockey team based in Washington, D.C. and patriciapte in the NHL or National Hockey League. The team was founded in the 1974-1975 season. The team owner was a man by the name of Abe Pollin. The first several seasons, the team struggled to be competetive against better staffed teams and was the worst in the NHL. The team continued to struggle through the rest of the 1970's and 1980's. In fact, during the summer of 1982, the team was undergoing talks to move from D.C. This event kickstarted a campaign called 'Save the Caps.' </p> <p>Throughout the early 90's the team improved drastically with new and improved player trades and changes in team management. David Poile was hired as the general manager and acquired Rod Langway, Brian Engblom, Doug Jarvis, and Craig Laughlin. This moved help save the franchise. In fact, the Capitals made the playoffs for the the next 14 years in a row. In 1998, the team was the Eastern Conference Champions and continued to thrive into the early 2000's. </p> <p> The latest era of the Capitals story has come to be known as the Alexander Ovechkin era. Ovechkin was acquired in 2004 and selected Alexander Ovechkin first overall. Since the acquisition the team has been up and down and culmindated in a victory over the Chicago Blackhawks in the annual Winter Classic which was held at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.</p> <!--source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals !-->
